          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p class="p-space">A11y Learning is aimed to help students of design and web development to learn about accessibility so they can create accessible products for everyone.</p>
          <p class="p-space">A11y learning provides quick quizzes and links about accessibility, and an option to create notes about what you have learned.</p>
          <p>The outcome of this project highlights the importance of creating web pages and apps that everyone can use. </p>

        <!-- Problem -->
        <article class="sps problem">
          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p class="p-space">Unfortunately, there are still many designers and developers that do not apply accessibility guidelines to their projects for many reasons, such as the many rules they have to learn or a lack of time to study the subject.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand, everyone has to have the same right to use websites or applications. Something needs to be done to create knowledge and conscious awareness so we can make disabled people’s lives easier when using websites or
            applications. </p>
        </article>
        <!-- Solution -->
        <article class="sps solution">
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>After the research process, I got a clear picture of the target market and understood some student’s reasons for not applying the accessibility guidelines in their projects. From this, A11y Learning was born to help students to learn
            accessibility consistently using just 10 to 30 minutes per day. </p>

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p class="p-space">I did a competitive analysis of the competitors: <a href="https://www.deque.com/android-accessibility/" target="_blank">AXE,</a> <a href="https://www.wcagchecklist.com/" target="_blank">WCAG Accessibility Checklist,</a>
            and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/color-contrast/id1095478187" target="_blank">Contrast Color,</a> to better understand the current market.</p>
          <div class="first-competitor">
            <p class="competitor-text">AXE for Android is an accessibility analysis tool aimed to help designers and developers to analyze the accessibility issues on Android.</p>

          <h4>Takeaways</h4>
          <p><span class="bold">What I learned from the Competitive Analyses</span> is that a new competitor could enter into this marketplace by creating a new app about accessibility, but some requirements have to be observed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean design</li>
            <li>Free app</li>
            <li>Accessible app</li>
            <li>Tutorial to teach how to use the product</li>
            <li>Engaging, to have more positive reviews</li>
            <li>Good marketing campaign to show people how important it is to create accessible products</li>
            <li>Illustrative of the importance of accessibility to Designers and Developers</li>
            <li class="no-space">Application for iOS and Android</li>

            <p class="p-space">After that, I created a <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/TuNKNAoxTrcQ9HoTyF6ut0/Capstone-Project?node-id=764%3A624&viewport=121%2C43%2C0.29693594574928284&scaling=min-zoom" target="_blank">mood board</a> to show the

              typography and the color palette that I have chosen for this project.</p>
            <p class="p-space">As a primary color for this project, I have chosen shades of blue with shades of pink as a secondary color. According to the psychology of colors, blue is a color that reflects calm, relaxation, stability, trust, and
              loyalty. Additionally, pink is a color that is associated with love, kindness, and compassion. </p>
            <p><span class="bold">A11y Learning wants users to see the platform as a source of trustworthy support where they can learn a new skill that will transform people’s lives for the better.</span></p>

          <p>The next step in the process was the creation of the high fidelity mockups. After receiving useful feedback on the wireframes, I made some changes to improve usability. For example, I removed one page from the quiz start-up process by
            adding the course progress to the same page where I display the course levels. </p>

          <h3>Prototypes and Usability Testing</h3>
          <p class="p-space">After that, I did the prototypes and <span class="bold">conducted usability tests with 3 users: Anuka, Dan, and Erit.</span> I asked them to complete the <span class="bold">sign in process using their email, find the
              tutorial, start the quiz, write a note, use the
              links feature, change their goals, and view their achievements on the course.</span> They all have experience using applications on a daily basis and gave me very useful feedback. </p>
          <p class="p-space">Anuka was a little confused about the sign in process because I started the test showing the tutorial instead of the landing page. She also said that it would be good to add information about the goals and achievements
            in the tutorial.</p>
          <p class="p-space">Dan said that the sign in process was a little confusing because I alternated too freely between the phrases “sign in” and “log in”. Also, he suggested that I explain a little more why the questions on the quiz are
            right or wrong. In addition, he said that maybe it would be better to use the homepage icon in the middle of the menu bar and to have a bigger plus sign to create a note. He said that the homepage was a little unbalanced because I have
            three items, and it is hard to make three items appear symmetrical.</p>
          <p class="p-space">Erit said it was a little confusing how I presented the tutorial first and the landing page second. She also said that it would be good if I added the ability to choose different goals while testing.</p>
          <p class="p-space">In addition to the critical feedback, they gave me positive feedback on many points. All three users said that the app was a great idea and that I should bring it to life. They also all told me that they loved my
            design. </p>
          <p>I am very grateful to my testers for their encouragement and for helping me find some flaws to iterate the product in the early stages. </p>
