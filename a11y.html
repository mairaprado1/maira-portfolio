        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p class="p-space">A11y Learning is aimed to help students of design and web development to learn about accessibility so they can create accessible products for everyone.</p>
        <p class="p-space">A11y learning provides quick quizzes and links about accessibility, and an option to create notes about what you have learned.</p>
        <p>The outcome of this project highlights the importance of creating web pages and apps that everyone can use. </p>
      </article>

      <!-- Problem -->
      <article class="sps problem">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p class="p-space">Unfortunately, there are still many designers and developers that do not apply accessibility guidelines to their projects for many reasons, such as the many rules they have to learn or a lack of time to study the subject.
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, everyone has to have the same right to use websites or applications. Something needs to be done to create knowledge and conscious awareness so we can make disabled people’s lives easier when using websites or
          applications. </p>
      </article>
      <!-- Solution -->
      <article class="sps solution">
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>After the research process, I got a clear picture of the target market and understood some student’s reasons for not applying the accessibility guidelines in their projects. From this, A11y Learning was born to help students to learn
          accessibility consistently using just 10 to 30 minutes per day. </p>

        <h3>User Survey</h3>
        <p class="p-space">I conducted a User Survey, where I obtained 33 responses, to understand the student’s reasons for not applying accessibility guidelines to the design and development of their projects, and whether an application to help
          them learn accessibility would be successful in the current market. </p>
        <p>From this survey, I discovered that 100% of the respondents are in some way familiar and interested in web accessibility, but 21.2% do not apply any accessibility rules to their projects.</p>

<p>I also asked those respondents <span class="bold">how much time per week they spent </span>last semester <span class="bold">trying to learn about accessibility,</span> and 30.8% said between 0 and 1 hour per week, 38.5% said between 1 and 2 hours per week, 7.7% said between 2 and 3 hours per week, 15.4% said 3 to 4 hours or more per week, and 7.7% said that they did not spend any time per week. </p>

  <p>of the respondents <span class="bold">would like to work for a company that cares about accessibility</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">What I learned from this survey</span> is that <span class="bold">students who apply or do not apply</span> the accessibility guidelines <span class="bold">have the same problems: lack of knowledge, lack of time to study the subject, and lack of time to apply the rules.</span> It is worth noting that 87.9% of survey participants want to work for a company that cares about accessibility, so it is essential to alleviate these problems. </p>
